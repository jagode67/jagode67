### Hola, I'm Javi üëã

<img src="https://javigomez.org/img/cod.png" alt="Logo del Proyecto">

I am currently working as a teacher of various technical subjects (Web Developers, Web Desing, Programation, Systems) within the Training Cycles of Web Application Development at ESIC. In the previous 10 years I was working as Head of User Experience and Graphic Interface within the Telefonica Telco 3.0 project, which is the reconstruction of all management services and services of Telef√≥nica. My background like technical engineer, and my experience in the areas of user experience allows me to have an end-to-end front-end view, knowing the technical limitations, speaking both the technical area as the functional area to find viable solutions and usable.
In my nearly 30 years of experience, I have been through technical positions, leading development teams and systems. In recent times I have worked in equipment User Experience and Interaction Design.
